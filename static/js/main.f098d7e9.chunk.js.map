Before entering the service\n                I had never really been very interested or knowledgeable about computers. The navy really introduced me to technology and from there\n                is where my drive to continue in the field started.</p>\n            <p>I later earned a few more certifications while working at Navakai in Colorado Springs. Upon being hired, we had 90 days\n                to become a MCP(Microsoft Certified Professional). Our company had a partnership with Microsoft, so 70% of our IT staff had to be\n                certified.\n            </p>\n            <p> At Leitner-Poma of America, I have had little time to acquire certifications and instead was at the point where I could really\n                put all my training into practice. Upon moving to the developer role, I started doing most of my training with Udemy courses.\n                These courses tend to focus on web-app development ranging in technologies such as PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I have also\n                began to learn some popular frameworks used for web development.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default Certifications\n\n// ReactDOM.render(\n//   <React.StrictMode>\n//     <About/>\n//   </React.StrictMode>,\n//   document.getElementById('content')\n// );","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Navy.1d678774.jpg\";","import React from 'react';\nimport navyImage from './Navy.jpg';\nimport Table from 'react-bootstrap/Table';\nimport '../App.css';\n\nconst Home = () => {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"panel-container\">\n        <div className=\"left-panel\">\n          <h2><b>Who am I?</b></h2>\n          <p>My name is Jeremy LaGree.

In that time I traveled to many different countries and learned\n          a ton about all different kinds of computer systems. \n          </p>\n          <p>\n          After leaving the military I was hired at a MSP company in Colorado Springs.\n          There, I was a tier II technician where my focus was on Help Desk and server\n          maintenance and administration. While living in Colorado Springs I also attended\n          the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs (UCCS) to pursue a degree in Computer Science. \n          I later left the company to move back to Grand Jucntion and finish\n          my computer science degree at CMU.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n          Currently, I live in Grand Junction and work for a company called Leitner-Poma\n          of America. I was initially hired to do helpdesk and domain administration which is what I did for my first\n          few years of employment here. I was just recently moved into the position of web app development which \n          has been a transition I looked forward to as my interest in doing IT support has declined over the years. \n          I still struggle with some of the technologies, as the sytem at LPOA has \n          been in place for quiet some time which makes it all very complex. While it has not been\n          extremely inviting to a new developer, I am getting by and hope to continue to grow with the company\n          and grow as a developer!\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div className='right-panel'>\n          <h2><b>Previous Experience</b></h2>\n          <Table striped bordered hover variant=\"dark\">\n            <thead>\n              <tr>\n                <th>Years</th>\n                <th>Position</th>\n              </tr>\n            </thead>\n            <tbody>\n              <tr>\n                <td>2020-Present</td>\n                <td>Full Stack Web-App Development, Leitner-Poma of America</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>2018-2020</td>\n                <td>Helpdesk/Network Administrator, Leitner-Poma of America</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>2018-Present</td>\n                <td>BS, Computer Science, Colorado Mesa University</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>2016-2018</td>\n                <td>Tier II Network Administrator, Navakai Inc.</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>2016-2018</td>\n                <td>BS, Computer Science, University of Colorado, Colorado Springs</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>2012-2016</td>\n                <td>Information Systems Technician, United States Navy</td>\n              </tr>\n            </tbody>\n          </Table>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      );\n}\n\nexport default Home\n","import React from 'react'\n\nconst Contact = () => {\n    return (\n        <div>\n            <h1>Contact!</h1>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default Contact\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/header.79541e45.jpeg\";","import React from 'react'\nimport headerImage from './header.jpeg';\nimport '../App.css';\n\nconst Banner = () => {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"bannerDiv\">\n            <img src={headerImage} alt=\"Header-image\"/>\n            <div className=\"imageText\">My React Website</div>\n        </div>       \n    )\n}\n\nexport default Banner;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport '../App.css';\n\nconst Footer = () => {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"footer\">\n            <h3>Created by Jeremy LaGree</h3>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default Footer;","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport NavMenu from './components/NavMenu';\nimport {BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport Certifications from './components/Certifications';\nimport Home from './components/Home';\nimport Contact from './components/Contact';\nimport Banner from './components/Banner';\nimport Footer from './components/Footer';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Router>\n      <div className='App'>\n        <Banner/>\n        <NavMenu/>\n        <Route path='/' exact component={Home}/>\n        <Route path='/home' component={Home}/>\n        <Route path=\"/certifications\" component={Certifications}/>\n        <Route path='/contact' component={Contact}/>\n        <Footer/>\n      </div>\n    </Router>\n  );\n}\n\n\nexport default App;\n\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\nimport 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <App />,\n  document.getElementById('content')\n\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
