In that time I traveled to many different countries and learned\n                a ton about all different kinds of computer systems. \n                </p>\n                <p>\n                After leaving the military I was hired at a MSP company in Colorado Springs.\n                There, I was a tier II technician where my focus was on Help Desk and server\n                maintenance and administration. I earned my Security plus and windows server 2012 \n                certifications.
