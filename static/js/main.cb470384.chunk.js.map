I am currently in my senior year at\n                Colorado Mesa University. I am writing this page for an assignment\n                to test our knowledge with using a React-App.\n          </p>\n          <h2>Previous Experience</h2>\n          <p>\n          I spent four years in the United States Navy as an Information systems\n          technicain. In that time I traveled to many different countries and learned\n          a ton about all different kinds of computer systems. \n          </p>\n          <p>\n          After leaving the military I was hired at a MSP company in Colorado Springs.\n          There, I was a tier II technician where my focus was on Help Desk and server\n          maintenance and administration. I earned my Security plus and windows server 2012 \n          certifications. I later left the company to move back to Grand Jucntion and finish\n          my computer science degree at CMU.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n          Currently, I live in Grand Junction (obviously) and work for a company called Leitner-Poma\n          of America. I was just recently moved into the position of web app development there after \n          previously running the help desk. It has been a transition I looked forward to and it has certianly\n          been a learning experience. I still struggle with many of the technologies, as the sytem has \n          been in place for quiet some time which makes it all very complex. While it has not been\n          extremely inviting to a new developer, I am getting by and hope to continue to grow with the company\n          and grow as a developer!\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div className='right-panel'>\n          <Table striped bordered hover variant=\"dark\">\n            <thead>\n              <tr>\n                <th>Years</th>\n                <th>Position</th>\n              </tr>\n            </thead>\n            <tbody>\n              <tr>\n                <td>2020-Present</td>\n                <td>Full Stack Web-App Development, Leitner-Poma of America</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>2018-2020</td>\n                <td>Helpdesk/Network Adminitrator, Leitner-Poma of America</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>2018-Present</td>\n                <td>BS, Computer Science, Colorado Mesa University</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>2016-2018</td>\n                <td>Tier II Network Adminitrator, Navakai Inc.</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>2016-2018</td>\n                <td>BS, Computer Science, University of Colorado, Colorado Springs</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>2012-2016</td>\n                <td>Information Systems Technician, United States Navy</td>\n              </tr>\n            </tbody>\n          </Table>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      );\n}\n\nexport default Home\n","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport NavMenu from './components/NavMenu';\nimport {BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport Certifications from './components/Certifications';\nimport Home from './components/Home';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Router>\n      <div className='App'>\n        <NavMenu/>\n        <Route path='/' exact component={Home}/>\n        <Route path='/home' component={Home}/>\n        <Route path=\"/certifications\" component={Certifications}/>\n      </div>\n    </Router>\n  );\n}\n\n\nexport default App;\n\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\nimport 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <App />,\n  document.getElementById('content')\n\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
