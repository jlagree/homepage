          <p>My name is Jeremy LaGree. I am currently in my senior year at
                Colorado Mesa University. I am writing this page for an assignment
                to test our knowledge with using a React-App.

          <h2><b>About Me!</b></h2>
          <p>
            I grew up here in the valley and went to Central high school. At Central I played football, baseball, and golf.
            After I graduated, I decided to join the military. 
          </p>
          <p>
          I spent four years in the United States Navy as an Information systems
          technicain. In that time I traveled to many different countries and learned
          a ton about all different kinds of computer systems. 
          </p>
          <p>
          After leaving the military I was hired at a MSP company in Colorado Springs.
          There, I was a tier II technician where my focus was on Help Desk and server
          maintenance and administration. While living in Colorado Springs I also attended
          the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs (UCCS) to pursue a degree in Computer Science. 
          I later left the company to move back to Grand Jucntion and finish
          my computer science degree at CMU.
          </p>

          <p>
          Currently, I live in Grand Junction and work for a company called Leitner-Poma
          of America. I was initially hired to do helpdesk and domain administration which is what I did for my first
          few years of employment here. I was just recently moved into the position of web app development which 
          has been a transition I looked forward to as my interest in doing IT support has declined over the years. 
          I still struggle with some of the technologies, as the sytem at LPOA has 
          been in place for quiet some time which makes it all very complex. While it has not been
          extremely inviting to a new developer, I am getting by and hope to continue to grow with the company
          and grow as a developer!
          </p>

          <h2><b>Hobbies!</b></h2>
          <p>
            I like to do all the standard Colorado stuff like hiking, snowboarding, camping, and hunting. Of that list
            I would argue that snowboarding has to be my favorite. I have been to almost every resort in Colorado and would have
            to say that Breckenridge and Steamboat my number 1's. 
          </p>
          <p>In the summer months, most of my time is spent golfing or camping. For how much I golf I should be a lot better, but nothing
            beats being on the course on a nice summer day. Camping is usually a weekend thing and I try to go whenever I can. We have a few 
            4-Wheelers and a side-by-side, so our trips usually include a long ride and a few mud puddles.
