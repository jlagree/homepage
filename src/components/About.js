                <p>My name is Jeremy LaGree. I am currently in my senior year at
                Colorado Mesa University. I am writing this page for an assignment
                to test our knowledge with using a React-App.

                <p>
                I spent four years in the United States Navy as an Information systems
                technicain. In that time I traveled to many different countries and learned
                a ton about all different kinds of computer systems. 
                </p>

                After leaving the military I was hired at a MSP company in Colorado Springs.
                There, I was a tier II technician where my focus was on Help Desk and server
                maintenance and administration. I earned my Security plus and windows server 2012 
                certifications. I later left the company to move back to Grand Jucntion and finish
                my computer science degree at CMU.
                </p>

                <p>
                Currently, I live in Grand Junction (obviously) and work for a company called Leitner-Poma
                of America. I was just recently moved into the position of web app development there after 
                previously running the help desk. It has been a transition I looked forward to and it has certianly
                been a learning experience. I still struggle with many of the technologies, as the sytem has 
                been in place for quiet some time which makes it all very complex. While it has not been
                extremely inviting to a new developer, I am getting by and hope to continue to grow with the company
                and grow as a developer!
