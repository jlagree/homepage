                <h1>Certifications/Training Background</h1>
                <p>I received most of my certifications and training through the military. Before entering the service
                    I had never really been very interested or knowledgeable about computers. The navy really introduced me to technology and from there
                    is where my drive to continue in the field started.</p>
                <p>I later earned a few more certifications while working at Navakai in Colorado Springs. Upon being hired, we had 90 days
                    to become a MCP(Microsoft Certified Professional). Our company had a partnership with Microsoft, so 70% of our IT staff had to be
                    certified.
                </p>
                <p> At Leitner-Poma of America, I have had little time to acquire certifications and instead was at the point where I could really
                    put all my training into practice. Upon moving to the developer role, I started doing most of my training with Udemy courses.
                    These courses tend to focus on web-app development ranging in technologies such as PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I have also
                    began to learn some popular frameworks used for web development.
